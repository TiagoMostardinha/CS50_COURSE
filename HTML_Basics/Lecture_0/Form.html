<!-- when we want some information form the user we need to create a form-->
<!-- To get information we need an input and use the type tag to specify what's the format of the input if it's a text,number,scroll,etc.-->
<!-- placeholder it's a tag where the input will have a default text or value-->
<!-- name it's tag that will give a name to the objetct(in this a case to the input), this will be useful to know which input field corresponds-->
<!--to which value, just so that later on we'll be able to reference them-->
<!--submit is a kinda of information from type, that will provide the user to submit what he wrote-->
